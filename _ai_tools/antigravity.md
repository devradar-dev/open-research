Google Antigravity is an **Agent-First AI IDE** developed by Google, built on VS Code with Gemini 3 integration. Unlike traditional AI coding tools, Antigravity features a **Mission Control dashboard** for managing multiple autonomous agents in parallel workspaces.

## Key Features

**Three-Surface Architecture:**
1. **Editor Surface**: Multi-file edits, code analysis
2. **Terminal Surface**: Shell command execution (npm, git, build tools)
3. **Browser Surface**: Integrated browser for visual verification (localhost inspection, screenshots)

**Gemini 3 Integration:**
- **Gemini 3 Pro**: 1M+ token context for repo-scale reasoning
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Low-latency for rapid iteration
- **Deep Think**: Extended reasoning for complex architectural decisions

**Agent Manager (Mission Control):**
- Spawn parallel agents (Refactor auth, Investigate CI test, Update README)
- Dashboard view of agent status
- Asynchronous execution (developer reviews, AI executes)

**MCP Integration:**
- Database connections (PostgreSQL, Supabase, MongoDB)
- Cloud infrastructure (GCP, BigQuery, Cloud Run)
- Collaboration tools (GitHub, Linear, Slack, Notion)

**Hardware Requirements:**
- **macOS**: Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4), Intel unsupported
- **Windows**: Windows 10+ with WSL2 required
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+, Fedora 36+, RHEL 8+

## Best For
- Full-stack refactoring with browser-based UI verification
- Google Cloud ecosystem developers
- Teams wanting parallel agent workflows
- "Vibe Coding" from natural language or screenshots

## Avoid For
- Intel Mac users (unsupported)
- Offline development (requires connectivity)
- Enterprises blocking WSL2 (Windows requirement)
