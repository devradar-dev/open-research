Trae is a **dual-mode AI IDE** from ByteDance featuring traditional IDE editing and autonomous **SOLO Mode**. It offers **free access** to frontier models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek) and supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extensibility.

## Key Features

**Dual-Mode Operation:**
- **IDE Mode**: Next-Edit Prediction via Context Understanding Engine (CUE)
- **SOLO Mode**: Autonomous agent with Chain-of-Thought planning and self-healing

**Context Understanding Engine (CUE):**
- Semantic graph of repository (relationships across files)
- Dynamic indexing (up to 5,000 files)
- Multimodal (screenshot → code generation)

**Free Intelligence:**
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200k context)
- GPT-4o & GPT-5.2
- DeepSeek V3 (cost-efficient)
- Local models via Ollama

**MCP Integration:**
- Supabase, Neon, PlanetScale database management
- Vercel, Netlify, Railway deployment
- Kamal, Coolify self-hosted PaaS

## Concerns

**Privacy & Telemetry:**
- High-volume data collection (heartbeat every 30 sec)
- WebSocket connections to mon-va.byteoversea.com
- Device fingerprints, file paths, edit frequencies tracked
- "Privacy Mode" doesn't sever telemetry links

**Enterprise Risk:**
- No SOC 2 Type II certification
- ByteDance ownership (data sovereignty concerns)
- Potential data access per legal requirements in home jurisdiction

## Best For
- Indie developers, students, bootstrappers
- Rapid prototyping with free frontier models
- Founders wanting "Idea to App" speed
- Vibe coding with visual inputs

## Avoid For
- Enterprise proprietary core IP
- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, defense)
- Organizations requiring SOC 2/HIPAA compliance
